Game/Golf version 0.01
======================

The Log::Procmail module processes procmail(1) logfiles and returns
the abstracts. You can get all the useful information by using the
methods from(), date(), subject(), folder() and size() on the returned
Log::Procmail::Abstract object.

This is a very simple module. :-)
